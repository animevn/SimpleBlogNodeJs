    Doyle. Referring to himself as a "consulting detective" in the stories, Holmes is known for
    his proficiency with observation, deduction, forensic science, and logical reasoning that
    borders on the fantastic, which he employs when investigating cases for a wide variety of
    clients, including Scotland Yard.
